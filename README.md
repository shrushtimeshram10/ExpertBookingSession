# 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |

# 🔒 Double Booking Prevention

The system prevents double bookings using **MongoDB atomic operations** with strict conditions.

If two users try booking the same expert, date, and slot simultaneously:

- ✅ One booking succeeds
- ❌ The other receives a conflict error

This ensures complete race-condition safety.

---

# ⚡ Real-Time Updates

Using **Socket.io**, slot availability updates instantly across all connected clients.

When a booking is made:

- The server emits a `slot-booked` event
- All users viewing that expert page instantly see the slot disabled
- No page refresh required
